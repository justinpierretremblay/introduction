# Project 1: Introduction [![tests](../../../badges/submit-proj1/pipeline.svg)](../../../pipelines/submit-proj1/latest)

1. Define in your own words what a node, topic, publisher, and subscriber are and how they relate
to each other.

 - Node:       A node represents a computational unit that can receive and trasmit messages, while performing specific tasks.

 - Topic:      A topic is a channel where nodes can exchange messages. Nodes can publish messages to topics, while nodes can
               also subscribe to these topics to receive them.

 - Publisher:  A publisher sends messages through a specific topic, allowing nodes to subscribe and receive the information.

 - Subscriber: A subscriber sends received messages from certain topics to nodes. 

2. What is the purpose of a launch file?

 - The purpose of a launch file is to configure and launch multiple nodes, parameters, connections between nodes, and specific
   parameters to set. 

3. For some reason when trying to run rviz with the new map, I could not load the new map. Will go to Office Hours to resolve.
